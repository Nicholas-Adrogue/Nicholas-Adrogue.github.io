            <h2>About Nico</h2>
            Hello, my name is Nicholas Adrogue, but you can call me Nico! I am a second year Applied Mathematics Master's student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I graduated from Tufts University in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I worked for a year as an Environmental Specialist.
            I am passionate about using mathematics and computational methods to solve complex real-world problems. My interests include computational biology and chemistry, data science, and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, sailing, and swimming.
